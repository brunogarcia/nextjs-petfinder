# A Next.js app with the Petfinder API

A simple, statically generated application that uses the Petfinder API to display pets available for adoption and recently adopted.

All of the site's content will be pre-rendered in advance with the exception of pets available for adoption, which the user can update on the client-side.

Following the instructions of the course **Static Site Generation with Next.js and TypeScript**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Run the development environment (on port 3000 by default). With fast refresh, each time you edit the application's source code, the change instantly gets reflected in the running application, all while preserving the application's current state. This fast feedback loop keeps you productive and uninterrupted during development.

### `npm run build`

Build an optimized version of the application and generate the pre-rendered pages.

### `npm run start`

Spin up the application in production mode.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint on the codebase.
